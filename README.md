## wondering about .hrc or .clj+
### .hrc
.hrc is a file format I created myself for my heirachy format v2\main.py will convert these to python nested lists of strings.
### .clj+
.clj+ is a coding language i created inspired by clojure which you can convert to my binary file format with .clj+ to code.py (not made yet) the python terminal will return a binary structure which can be ran on x86 with my coding language for x86.py (not made yet).

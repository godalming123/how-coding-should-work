# how-coding-should-work
My vision as to how coding should work in the future.
## if your wondering about .hrc or .hrcc
### .hrc
.hrc is a file format I created myself for my heirachy format v2\main.py will convert these to python nested lists of strings.
### .hrcc
.hrcc is heirachy but with a c on the end this stands for code and means it is my coding language so when you convert it with heir to code.py (not made yet) the python terminal will return a binary structure which can be ran on x86 with my coding language for x86.py (not made yet).

## wondering about .arrh or .arr  
### .arrh on
 .arrh on is a file format I created myself for my heirachy format v2\main.py will convert these to python nested lists of strings.
### .arr
 .arr is a coding language I created inspired by clojure which you can convert to my binary file format with .arr to code.py (not made yet) the python terminal will return a binary structure which can be ran on x86 with my coding language for x86.py (not made yet).
# todo
* add variable types (currently code marks every variable as unidentified ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚)
* add binary to x86 file (for running code on x86)
* add linitng
